# IR Remote and Bluetooth-Controlled Appliance System

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control appliances via an IR remote and Bluetooth. It integrates both IR and Bluetooth control for home automation with efficient energy usage.

## Features
- Control up to 3 appliances.
- Can be operated via an IR remote or Bluetooth.
- Uses relay modules to switch the appliances.

## How to Use
1. Upload the code to an ESP32.
2. Connect the relays to GPIO pins 21, 22, and 23.
3. Use either the IR remote or a Bluetooth app to control the appliances.
